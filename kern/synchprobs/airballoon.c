/*
 * Design:
 *  data structure: an array of ropes (integers)
 *      - the indices represent the rope and balloon hook number
 *          (note that these are the same because Lord FlowerKiller
 *          never changes the ropes on the balloon hook's side.)
 *      - the values in the array represent the stakes that the
 *          ropes are attached to.
 *
 *  synchronization primitives:
 *      - semaphore rope_sem: a semaphore used by the main function 
 *          to keep track of the four threads (dandelion, marigold, 
 *          balloon, flowerkiller).
 *      - lock rope_locks[NROPES]: an array of locks to protect
 *          the ropes.
 *      - lock ropes_left_lock: a lock to protect the ropes_left variable
 *      - semaphore done_sem: a semaphore used by the balloon thread
 *          to keep track of the other three threads (dandelion,
 *          marigold, flowerkiller). It is just used to make sure
 *          that the statement "Balloon freed and Prince Dandelion
 *          escapes!" is printed after the other threads have finished
 *          their respective print statements. 
 * 
 *  locking protocols and invariants:
 *      - whenever a thread does something with a rope, it has to
 *          acquire the rope's lock first. After it's done, it decrements
 *          the protected ropes_left variable (except for flowerkiller,
 *          who does not decrement ropes_left), and releases the lock.
 *      - threads know they are done if the ropes_left variable reaches
 *          0, signifying that all ropes have been successfully severed.
 *      - after the dandelion, marigold, and flowerkiller threads have
 *          finished, they call V on the done_sem semaphore, which is
 *          being P'd by the balloon thread. Once the balloon thread
 *          finishes P'ing the done_sem semaphore, it prints out the
 *          "Balloon freed and Prince Dandelion escapes!" message.
 *      - after all four (dandelion, marigold, balloon, flowerkiller)
 *          threads have finished, they call V on the rope_sem semaphore,
 *          which the main function is P'ing on. The problem is "solved"
 *          once the main function has succeessfully called P on
 *          all four threads.
